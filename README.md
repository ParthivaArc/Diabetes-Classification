# Diabetes-Classification
This is a Kaggle based dataset on diabetes classification and prediction, where various health factors such as BMI, Blood Pressure, Age, Insulin and so on factors onset the prediction of diabetes. Various classification model such as logistic regression, random forest, decision tree, and SVM was performed out of which Random Forest outperformed others as a result of which the random forest model was fine tuned to achieve better accuracy.
Furthermore, dummy data was entered keeping in mind the feature variable that was used to build the model and then prediction was made. Hope u will like it :)

The work is divided into two noteboks-
1. For visualization of the dataset refer to Diabetes EDA file
2. For diabetes prediction and check various models used refer to Diabetes Classification file
